              <h4>Profile</h4>
              <p>Jack Donoghue is an American producer, musician, and visual artist who emerged as the main beat-maker of SALEM at age 18. While best known for pioneering the witch house genre, Donoghue has developed a multifaceted career spanning production, directing, and multiple musical projects.</p>
              <h4>Musical Background and SALEM</h4>
              <p>Donoghue met bandmate John Holland on the streets of Chicago before all three members decided to make music as SALEM. His production approach was deeply informed by Southern rap, which he blended with ethereal electronica to create SALEM's signature narcotically heavy sound. He openly discussed his creative process, explaining that he created songs like "Haffa" while high on OxyContin, stating he didn't think he would have been able to achieve that sound otherwise. His production philosophy embraced the darker aspects of drug culture and night life, creating what critics described as music that sounded profoundly spun-out and creepy.</p>
              <h4>Production Work and Collaborations</h4>
              <p>Beyond SALEM, Donoghue built an impressive production resume. He earned credit as one of six additional producers on Kanye West's "Black Skinhead" from the Yeezus album, contributing to what became a goth stadium anthem. His other work includes DJ mixing and production for the Patrik Ervell SS12 runway show music alongside araabMUZIK, and production work for Trinidad James on "10 Pc. Mild". He's also credited as a member of the project Young Cream and uses the alias 8:*).</p>
              <h4>Visual Work and Direction</h4>
              <p>Donoghue's artistic vision extends beyond audio production. He directed a disturbing video for SALEM's "Dirt," starring an aspiring actress and someone he found on Craigslist. Later, he co-directed the "Starfall" music video alongside Holland and Tommy Malekoff, which followed the band on a storm-chasing trip through Oklahoma and Texas during tornado season. His visual aesthetic matched his sonic approach—dark, provocative, and uncompromising.</p>
              <h4>Evolution and Continued Work</h4>
              <p>In early interviews, Donoghue noted that none of the band members had jobs, making it easy to fit in time to make music constantly, resulting in many songs that would likely never be heard. His influence on the witch house genre proved lasting, with his production techniques and aesthetic choices inspiring subsequent artists and finding their way into mainstream hip-hop production. Despite SALEM's notorious reputation for bad live performances and long hiatuses, Donoghue's work as a producer and his contributions to electronic music's darker corners remain significant.</p>
